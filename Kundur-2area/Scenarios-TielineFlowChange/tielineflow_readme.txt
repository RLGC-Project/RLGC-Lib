assuming fault applied at bus 9

The increase of the tieline flow will also increase the critical clearing time - this is becasue bus 9 is closes to generator 3 and 4, and when tieline flow increase, actually the output power of generator 3 and 4 decrease.

some cct :

base case: 0.55 seconds
tieline increase 110 MW case: 0.625 seconds
tieline decrease 100 MW case: 0.43 seconds
for other cases, cct will between the above value.
